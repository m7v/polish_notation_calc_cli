# Polish Notation Calculator

### What is it?

The term Polish notation is sometimes taken (as the opposite of infix notation) to also include reverse Polish notation.

When Polish notation is used as a syntax for mathematical expressions by programming language interpreters, it is readily parsed into abstract syntax trees and can, in fact, define a one-to-one representation for the same.

This project is emulator of _real_ enigma machine.
For more information and enigma works please [read wikipedia](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Polish_notation).

### Information
